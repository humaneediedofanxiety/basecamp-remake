So I hadn't touched css in almost 5-6 months so I remade basecamp.com landing page (only css)
Now I am finally done after around 8 hours of code, more like 8 hours of goofing around and coding in the middle.

Now there are a lot of problems with my code, I need to note them down.

-> A lot of hover animations missing.
-> No javascript.
-> Bad use of css positioning.
-> Shitty structure for both html and css.
-> Not even fucking responsive.

I think that is all.
But the good thing is atleast I finished it, so what are the next steps.

-> Learn advanced css. (advanced selectors, animations, transitions, latest features)
-> Master positioning and learn to build complex layouts using flexbox and grids.
-> Learn enough responsive web design and learn to think in responsive design.
-> Practice, practice and build lots of css components.
-> Learn Tailwind and remake some complex sites, maybe three or four.

I think that is all for it
